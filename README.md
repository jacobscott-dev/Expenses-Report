# Expenses Report

## Description

This project allows you to upload and output a csv file into a HTML table. Dummy data is displayed on project start up. 

It is assumed that the uploaded files are in the format of string, float, float, and represent an imaginary expenses report. 

The total cost per expense category is calculated before output. 
There is an option to download the displayed table in csv format. 

## Setup

This project requires a localhost setup with PHP installed. I would recommend XAMPP as this is the setup I have used. 
Once installed, you will need to save this project in the xampp/htdocs directory.

Next, run your Apache server from the XAMPP Control Panel. 
Open the windows command prompt (if on Windows) and navigate to the projects public directory e.g. xampp/htdoc/myProjects/Test/public

Run the following command with your desired port number > php -S localhost:port 

### Requirements 

* XAMPP
